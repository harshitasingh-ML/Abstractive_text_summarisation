# Abstractive_text_summarisation

# Encoder-Decoder Model:

For this problem I have used News Article data as they are rich is content and variation of it. Abstractive summary generation is challenging problem but with advancement of deeplearning this problem is solveble.
Here very basic set up of encoder and decoder model (LSTM) has been used to solve this problem, result is not very promising but this model has done good job till some extent.


### How to overcome shortcoming of this model:
Encoder-Decoder model with attention mechanism which will help retain the neighbours of word. Along with this pointer generation mechanism will improve the word selection.
